## Link to Deployed Project

## Project Description
### Why did I build this project?
* The purpose of the project was to build an online note taker, so that a
 user can save notes with a title and text for future reference and then delete the note when it is no longer needed. As this project required the data to be saved to the server. The note title and text are saved as object in /api/notes json. 
### What problems does this project overcome?
* The toughest part of this project was using Heroku and Express.js. Setting up the Heroku application to deploy the html was difficult as it required the package.json and node modules to be in the correct location within the repository. It was also difficult using the app.Post or app Delete functions in order to remove and save objects withint the /api/notes json. 
### What new skills did I learn?
* Learning to use Heroku and Express and connecting to the server to create a webpage with data saved to the server were the key skills I learned while developing the note taker.
